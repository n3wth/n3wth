              Kenn Adams, an improv teacher, wrote the story spine as a rehearsal exercise: seven
              fill-in-the-blank lines that force a shape onto whatever you feed them. Pixar story
              artists later made it famous. It works because it refuses abstraction; every line
              demands an event, and a decade of "responsible for" contains surprisingly few events.
              Feed it your own last ten years and notice where it snags. The snag is the story.

              bump maps, not full PBR sets, and for surfaces this small that's enough. Rodin turns
              reference photos into meshes, then ships materials that render black until you

              everyone. The flipbook runs on the reader's clock: scrub ties timeline progress to
              scroll position, so they conduct and they can conduct backwards. In GSAP these are
              toggleActions and scrub, and a trigger only gets one. Everything on this page picked
              a side: the spine and the bike are flipbooks, the opening line and these paragraphs
              are movies, and the teapot ignores both clocks because it answers to your pointer.
