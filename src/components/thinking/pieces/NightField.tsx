   Stage numbers double as the piece's spine: these are the real pipeline
   order (generation -> export -> runtime -> rigging -> the process that
   catches all four), not decoration — so the numbering is honest. */

            The first thing the night field did was go black. The homepage uses Blender for scene
            layout and Hyper3D Rodin for mesh generation. Rodin GLBs ship with the
            KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness extension and metalness set to 1. Under a point
            light with no environment map, that renders as pure black: no ambient, no diffuse,
            nothing. The fix takes three lines. Rebuild the material on load, drop metalness to
            0.15, set roughness to 0.7. Two floats. The problem is invisible unless you know what
            Rodin ships by default, and the error gives you nothing useful: a dark viewport where
            a mesh should be.

            The parked model orbited the wrong center. Blender's export_apply bakes object
            transforms into vertex coordinates, so any offset from origin gets permanently cooked
            into the mesh. The model sat wrong in the scene and rotated around a ghost point in
            empty space. The fix: zero the location, apply all transforms, and recenter geometry
            before export, in that order. It's a Blender hygiene rule that's easy to skip when
            you're iterating fast, and it only costs you when the model needs to sit somewhere
            specific.

            The scene went black on first load. WebGL context lost. In react-three-fiber, Suspense
            for async loads has to live inside the Canvas component. Put it outside and every
            useGLTF or useTexture call triggers a full Canvas remount. Chain enough of those
            together and the browser drops the WebGL context entirely. The surface error pointed
            at the GPU. The actual cause was Suspense placement, two components up the tree. That
            distance between symptom and source is what makes it slow to diagnose: you look at the
            wrong layer for a while before you find the real one.

            The four-legged creature's feet skated. The animation ran without a rig, using a
            skin-modifier skeleton decimated for a low-poly faceted look, body and legs as separate
            meshes articulated through pivot groups. The constraint is arithmetic: foot-ground
            speed must equal body travel speed. Amplitude times frequency times leg length. Those
            numbers have to agree, and there's no automatic feedback when they don't. Without a rig
            to enforce ground contact, nothing catches the drift. You adjust the keyframes and
            check again. You do that until the feet actually step.

            None of this got caught by one agent generating and shipping. It took a critique-panel
            workflow: a composition critic, a 3D-craft critic, and an anti-slop reviewer looking at
            renders separately, with a fixer agent gated on typecheck and screenshot confirmation.
            Capped at two or three rounds, because quality converges by then. More rounds just
            drift. The homepage is proof of the same argument made elsewhere on this site about
            production AI: agents generate, agents and humans review, in that order, on purpose.
