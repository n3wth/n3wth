/* Companion to the org-design piece: that one argues the leverage is in
   the org chart, not the model card. This one opens a single desk on that
   chart and asks what actually has to be true for it to count as a desk
   rather than a label — a trigger, a boundary, and a timestamp anyone can
   check without asking a person. The desks below are generic categories
   (a watcher, a reviewer, a self-updating status board, an inbox), not a
   roster of real project names — grounded in real cadences and real kinds
   of output, kept generic on purpose. Interaction is plain HTML buttons
   plus a swapped detail panel, reusing the kit's existing toggle/reveal
   classes rather than inventing new motion. */

            A desk on an org chart is a rectangle with a label in it until three more things are
            true. It fires on something other than a person remembering to click go. It is bounded
            — there's a specific list of what it's allowed to touch and what it isn't. And it
            leaves a timestamp: a real answer to "what did this desk actually do last," checkable
            without finding the person who set it up and asking them.
          </>

            Here are four, kept generic on purpose — the pattern is what matters, not whose
            project they run against. Click through them. Each one has a different trigger and a
            different boundary, and each one has something real it shipped, not a placeholder.

            The desk I trust least on any chart is the one whose status a person types by hand.
            It's accurate the day it's written and a guess every day after. A status board that
            rewrites its own table on a timer is a different object entirely — not because the
            underlying information is more sophisticated, but because the timestamp on it means
            something. Stale is a property of who's holding the pen, not of the information
            itself.

            Not every desk creates. The watcher desk above does the opposite: its entire job is
            noticing that another desk's output went missing or wrong, fast enough that it doesn't
            matter. That's why its cadence is the shortest of the four — thirty seconds, not
            fifteen minutes, not a push hook. A desk that only corrects has to check more often
            than a desk that produces, because the cost of noticing late is exactly the cost of not
            noticing at all.
          </>

      <Beat
        prose={
          <>
            What none of the four desks can tell you is whether they're still running. A cron job
            that silently stops doesn't announce it — the timestamp just stops updating, and
            nothing reads a timestamp that never changes as an event. The failure mode of a
            standing team isn't a desk doing the wrong thing. It's a desk that quietly stopped
            doing anything, weeks before someone notices the gap it left.

      <Blockquote className="mt-4 max-w-[48ch]" data-reveal>
        A desk isn't real because it's drawn on the chart. It's real because it has a schedule, a
        boundary, and a timestamp that updates without you.
