/* "What 'autonomous' actually means in production" — the argument is that
   the word describes two different things people conflate: the inner loop
   (plan, act, observe, self-correct without a human in that loop) and the
   scope of what the loop is allowed to touch (which a human decides, and
   which has nothing to do with how capable the loop is). The interactive
   specimen makes the second thing literal: a set of real actions an agent
   might take, click one, see whether it's reversible-so-the-loop-just-does-
   it or irreversible-so-a-human-signs-off, plus the one-line reason. Flat
   button grid, no cards — active state is a filled rect, not a shadow. No
   stage numbers: this is an argument, not a build log. */

            "Autonomous" gets applied to two different things, and the word doesn't distinguish
            between them. One is a loop: an agent perceives its environment, plans, acts, checks
            the result, and adjusts, without a human approving each step. The other is a boundary:
            what that loop is allowed to touch. The loop is a property of the system. The boundary
            is a decision someone made. Confusing the two is how "the agent is autonomous" ends up
            meaning "nobody's watching," which is not the same claim at all.
          </>

      <Beat
        prose={
          <>
            The loop itself is the easy part to describe. Hand an agent an objective and it writes
            a plan, executes code inside a sandbox — Docker, a disposable browser context, whatever
            container makes the attempt cheap to throw away — reads the runtime error or compiler
            output, and revises. It reaches out through a standardized interface like the Model
            Context Protocol to touch whatever the host system exposes: files, APIs, other tools.
            None of that requires a human in the loop, and none of it should feel controversial.
            A sandbox is built to be wrong in. That's what makes the self-correction cheap.

            Click through the list below. Every item on it is a real action an agent can take
            mid-task. Half of them the loop just does, because being wrong costs nothing — the
            attempt gets discarded and the next plan starts from a clean sandbox. The other half
            need a person to say go, because being wrong costs something that doesn't reset: money
            spent, a message already read, a database row that isn't coming back. The line isn't
            about how smart the agent is. It's about whether the action can be taken back.

            A multi-agent setup makes the boundary easier to see, not harder, because it forces you
            to draw it per desk instead of once for "the agent." A swarm broken into specialized
            desks — strategy, finance, growth — can continuously audit metrics, analyze funnels, and
            draft updates against the business plan entirely inside the loop. Auditing is
            perception. Drafting is a proposal. Nothing has left the building yet. The moment one of
            those desks wants to actually publish the update, or move money based on what finance
            found, the loop stops and a person picks it up. Same swarm, same models, two different
            categories of action running through it.

            What makes a setup "production-grade" isn't a bigger loop or a less supervised one.
            It's a boundary that's drawn on purpose, before the fact, instead of discovered after
            something irreversible happens. Low-overhead runtimes at the edge and a context backend
            that lets an agent pick up where the last one left off are what let the loop run more
            of the reversible half without a human babysitting each step. They don't move the line
            between reversible and not. That line doesn't get more permissive just because the
            infrastructure around it got better.

        "Autonomous" describes the loop. It says nothing about the leash — and the leash is the
        only part anyone should have to sign off on.
