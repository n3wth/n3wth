/* Twilio toll-free verification, told as a maze: each Beat is one real
   rejection or fix from the actual application (business_website,
   opt_in_type, business_type). The FlowDiagram compresses the three
   fields that mattered into forks — the value that gets rejected next to
   the value that doesn't — and the dead-end branches are exactly that:
   nodes with no outgoing edge, because that submission went nowhere.
   The final node (IN_REVIEW) is also a dead end structurally, but for a
   different reason — the outcome isn't known yet, which is the honest
   ending here, not a narrative gap. No account IDs, tokens, or the actual
   phone number appear anywhere; only the field names and enum values that
   actually decided the outcome. */

        A toll-free number needs Twilio's sign-off before it can send a single text. The
        application is one form — business details, opt-in method, use case. It reads like
        paperwork. It behaves like a maze: you can't see a wall until you've already walked into
        it, and the rejection notice is the only map you get.

            The number was for one narrow job: an AI voice hotline sending a single follow-up text
            after a call, capped low, filed under customer-care use. First submission came back
            rejected — business details inaccurate. The field at fault was business_website. It
            pointed at a personal domain that redirects elsewhere, and the reviewer followed the
            redirect to a page that matched nothing else in the application. Nothing else in the
            form was wrong. One URL sank the whole submission.
          </>

      <Beat
        stage={STAGES[1]}
        prose={
          <>
            Fix the website field, resubmit, and the wall moves. Second rejection — opt-in doesn't
            reflect the actual business. The field this time was opt_in_type, set to WEB_FORM, as
            if there were a signup box somewhere collecting numbers. There isn't. The only way
            anyone ends up on this list is by calling the hotline and hearing a disclosure before
            anything gets sent — that's VERBAL, a different enum value entirely. Twilio's taxonomy
            doesn't treat "close enough" as valid. WEB_FORM and VERBAL aren't two names for the
            same consent; they're different mechanisms with different proof requirements attached.

        prose={
          <>
            One more field got changed in that same pass, before it had the chance to reject
            anything on its own: business_type, set to SOLE_PROPRIETOR. Not because the business
            is legally structured that way in any deeper sense — because that value is the one
            that skips the business-registration-number and EIN fields, paperwork a one-person
            operation registered only with the city doesn't have. Reading the enum definitions
            before submitting instead of after is the one wall you can route around blind.
            Compressed into a single picture: three fields, each with a value that goes nowhere
            next to the value that doesn't. Nobody hands you this diagram going in. You build it
            out of rejection notices, one at a time.

            The application can only be edited while its status is rejected and editing is still
            allowed — miss that window, or miss the seven-day clock that keeps a resubmission in
            the priority queue, and the next attempt gets treated as brand new, back of the line.
            This round, the status flipped to in-review faster than expected, before two free-text
            fields — additional information, use-case summary — could be updated. They still cite
            the old domain and the old consent page. Whether that triggers a third rejection isn't
            known yet. The only way to fix those two fields now is to wait for that rejection to
            arrive.

        A maze doesn't publish its map. You learn each wall by walking into it, and you don't get
